</div>

Ved is a project which includes a software-embedded system named Drishti. Drishti is built with the vision of helping visually impaired people to study science, mathematics, technology and engineering concepts. Hence, eliminating the need of Braille (which has introduced a huge education gap in STEM for visually impaired people).

## Features of the application

- ### Concepts and Explanation:

  - The concept and Explanation feature comprises detailed easy to understand explanations of STEM concepts facilitated by read-aloud on-screen and text and visual features Adding to this, a live
    understanding of graphs and shapes can also be noted. Graphs are explained live with the help of audio
    frequency and pitch ranges whereas shapes are interpreted using raised pins on the hardware system.

- ### Test Yourself:

  - The test yourself feature comprises small theoretical quizzes to check the learning. Additionally, to
    this, the visually impaired person will answer the question through a real-time voice input feature and
    the answer will be checked using ML algorithms.

- ### Practice:

  - The practice feature enables visually impaired people to practice shapes, geometry, and tactile
    diagrams by sketching the figures on the screen (included in the hardware) with a live audio assistance
    feature. Once the figure is traced, it gets raised on the hardware keyboard generating the figure traced
    on the digital screen. Later, the sketched figure is checked for its accuracy using Machine Learning
    algorithms, and the outcome is read aloud by the application to improve the STEM concepts of the
    blind individual.

- ### Study Material:
    - Study Material comprises STEM curriculum books with voice read-aloud descriptions of text and
  visuals.

- Install any IDE like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio.
  [Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install)
  [Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

- Set up the Flutter environment in the preferred IDE (I preferred Android Studio).
  Checkout the [link](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/android-studio) for setting up the flutter environment.

- Set up the device to view the application either in Emulator or physical device.

  - To view application using Emulator, Follow the [link](https://tutorial.tips/create-android-emulator-for-flutter/)
  - To view application in physical device/ mobile phone, Follow the [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54444538/how-do-i-run-test-my-flutter-app-on-a-real-device)

- Once done with the set-up, clone the project in your local systems using the [link](https://github.com/ishitakapoor26/Signify.git).

- Go to pubspec.yaml and click on 'pub-get' (to fetch all the dependencies).

- Run the project by clicking on the Run button.

- Finally, you are all set to use the application!

## Technology Used

## Dependencies Used

- ### cupertino_icons:

      This is an asset repo containing the default set of icon assets used by Flutter's Cupertino widgets.
      Check out its usage at https://pub.dev/packages/cupertino_icons.

- ### intro_slider:

      Flutter Intro Slider is a flutter plugin that helps you make a cool intro for your app. Create intro has never been easier and faster.
      Check out its usage at https://pub.dev/packages/intro_slider.

- ### speech_to_text:

      A library that exposes device specific speech recognition capability.

      This plugin contains a set of classes that make it easy to use the speech recognition capabilities of the underlying platform in Flutter. It supports Android, iOS and web. The target use cases for this library are commands and short phrases, not continuous spoken conversion or always on listening.

      Check out its usage at https://pub.dev/packages/speech_to_text.

- ### avatar_glow:

      This Flutter package provides a Avatar Glow Widget with cool background glowing animation.

      Live Demo: https://apgapg.github.io/avatar_glow/
      Check out its usage at https://pub.dev/packages/avatar_glow.
